Part 2, \"Mercurius rusticus: or, The countries complaint, of the sacriledges, prophanations, and plundrings, committed by the schismatiques, on the cathedrall churches of this kingdome\" has separate title page with imprint \"Oxford, printed in the yeare, 1646\"; pagination and register are continuous with part 1. Parts 3 and 4, \"Querela Cantabrigiensis\" and \"Micro-chronicon\" each have separate dated title page, pagination, and register. The former is attributed to John Barwick, and the latter to Bruno Ryves. \"Querela Cantabrigiensis\" was also probably issued separately (Wing B1010), as was \"Micro-chronicon\" (Wing R2451)\nThis issue, the earlier, lacks an 8-page addition signed a which cancels leaf A8. This earlier issue is identified by Madan as 1890b*, one of the issues that constitute the second collected edition of those printed other than at Oxford.\n\"A generall bill of mortalitie, of the clergy of London\" by Matthew Griffin is found on p. 252-260 of part 2. It was first published as a broadside (Wing G2013) and it was not included in earlier editions of \"Mercurius rusticus\". Englands ruine.
